# Classification-of-Paddy-Plant-Disease-Detection-using-Deep-Learning-based-MobileNet-Algorithm.
It is used to classify the Paddy Plant disease like Healthy, BrownSpot and Leaf Blast with the help of deep learning based Mobile Net algorithm.

Here, we use the Five Module.

Datasets Collection : The data are collected in the kaggle website of paddy plant image like Healthy, BrownSpot and Leaf Blast.
Datasets PreProcessing : Data PreProcessing method are used to process the image into the proper format of the system.
Model Implementation : Here, we use the deep learning based Mobile Net algorithm to train the dataset.
Classification and Prediction :  User give the any type of paddy image file and then shown the output of which type of paddy plant disease. (Healthy, BrownSpot and Leaf Blast)
Performance Metrics : Here, we shown the result based accuracy, Classification report like precision, recall and F1 score value and finally shown the graph of accuracy and loss.
